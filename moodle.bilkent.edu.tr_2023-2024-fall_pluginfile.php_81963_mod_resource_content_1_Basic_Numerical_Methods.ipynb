    "As an example, an interval of space $[a,b]$  in 1-dimensions, can be represented by $N$ distinct space points. Between these points there exist finite distances, $Δx_i\\;{\\rm where}\\;i=1,\\dots, N$. The discretization of space can be uniform or non-uniform depending on the further techniques to be used. In any case, the function on discrete space points,\n",

    "These discrete values of the function can be represented by $f(x_i)$ or simply by using the index of the discrete pace point, $f_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the numerical computations depends on which method is employed to obtain an approximate analytical form that represents the function locally by using the distinct function values. The numerical method of obtaining an analytical form between the discrete points is called interpolation.\n",

All numerical methods are evaluated by considering their accuracy, computational complexity, and computational costs. Taylor series expansion is one of the most convenient methods for simple problems. But for high accuracy more advanced techniques are preferable. These methods will be studied in due course."
